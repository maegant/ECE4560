The final two weeks will be spent preparing for the final lab presentations. As such, the deliverable for the "lab" component of assignment 10 has a different due date than the course material portion.

Each group is asked to prepare a 5 minute presentation that includes the following:
1. One or more slides presenting your robot, including the number of joints and range of motion for each joint. This should be illustrated via a robot diagram
2. One or more slides introducing the behavior that you set out to achieve on your robot.
3. One or more slides explaining the procedure that you took to achieve your desired behavior. This should include a presentation of at least once concept from class (for example, if you use forward kinematics, please show at least one equation describing this computation)
4. One or more slides with videos of the final behavior that you were able to achieve
