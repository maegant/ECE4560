Your task for assignment 1 is to select a project group and select a project track (you can always switch later on if you change your mind, but you will start working with your selected robot next week). Additional information on each project track can be found using the links below.

To help select a project, you can also visit the Van Leer lab to see the existing robot arm (the Piktul and the Lynx arms) as well as the turtlebots. If you would like to see the TSRB space (for the bipeds) or the new robot arms, please come to Dr. Tucker's office hours in TSRB 442.
