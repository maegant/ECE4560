The biped thread is relatively new and involves coding your own class to control a statically stable planar biped robot. This thread involves forward kinematics and trajectory optimization. 

The main documentation for this thread can be found [here](https://pvela.gatech.edu/classes/doku.php?id=ece4560:biped:adventures).

One example of a final project with the biped can be seen below.

### Example final demonstration from Fall 2024
