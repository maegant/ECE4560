This week will focus on implementing inverse kinematics.
- The manipulator arm tracks will focus on performing inverse kinematics to compute initial and final joint configurations for the previous pick and place module.
- I’d like for the turtlebot group to also have hands-on experience with inverse kinematics. To do so, please work with a manipulator arm team to complete the inverse kinematics module. However, you may stick to simulation for this module if you’d like and create a visualization of the manipulator.
- The biped track will complete the resolved rate inverse kinematics module.
