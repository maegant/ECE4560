This assignment will start exploring trajectory generation.
- The manipulator arm tracks will create a cubic spline between two joint configurations.
- The turtlebot track will create a cubic spline between a initial and final global position.
- The biped track will perform the resolved rate and optimal control modules to produce a reference trajectory.
