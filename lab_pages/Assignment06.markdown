The lab deliverables will differ this week based on which project track you have selected. 
- The manipulator arm tracks will focus on achieving a "Pick and Place" behavior using known initial and final joint configurations.
- The mobile robot track will start to explore sensing.
- The biped track will complete a "Center of Mass" module to compute the COM for a given joint configuration.
