Command the Piktul planar robot arm to go to the home position using the ‘testforwardkin.m’ function provided and explained [here](https://pvela.gatech.edu/classes/doku.php?id=ece4560:piktul:02fkin). If you’d like
to go one step further, run the entire script to see the robot move to several pre-programmed positions.

Additional information on the Piktul robot arm is provided [here](https://pvela.gatech.edu/classes/doku.php?id=ece4560:manicontrol).
